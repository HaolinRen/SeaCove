# SeaCove
###Sea Cove
is an interactive search engine interface, We suggest to process snippets content and offer users a semantic map summarizing what topics pages relate to, and how these topics mix with one another.
###Usage
If you have installed NumPy library on your side, you could download all the files and run python Web/server.py, the web would be running on localhost:8080.
Otherwise, you can download only Web/client folder, and open the html directly, but some features may disable.
Just try it.
